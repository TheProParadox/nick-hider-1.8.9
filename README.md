The purpose of this mod is to provide a better experience to those who choose to share their game with others. The mod is simple (On the front-end at least). It replaces a players' own nick with their real name. For example, if I were nicked as "Hypixel9541", it would show as "Paradox" in all places. The mod also has a few more modes. The first of these modes forces all players to have a default skin. The second mode renames all from their default name to a pseudo generated name. All of these features should make stream sniping and the discovery of a player's nick significantly harder. The mod will only make a difference if the user is openly broadcasting their screen. It will not change how the player appears to anybody not using the mod. Any abuses of the mod will lead to it being revoked (There is a UUID based disable system).


The mod will do its best to detect and mask your nick. If you manually type a nick it will not be masked until it is applied but if you use the generate random nick tool, the nick will never appear on your screen while you use the mod. The mod was designed for Hypixel, I cannot guarantee that it will work on other servers.
